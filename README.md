# Requirements

You will need [Deno](https://deno.land) Installed.

# Config

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` in the root and fill in the values.

# Running

Running the bot is simple, execute the following:

```sh
deno run --allow-net --inspect main.ts
```

# Debugging

If you are using VSCode, the project includes a configuration for attaching to a running debugger; you should simply be able to push F5 while the bot is running using the command above.
